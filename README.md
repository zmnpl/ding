# ding - lightweight **d**ocument **ing**estion without bells and whistles

Ingest scanned pdf documents into your Documents directory structure with a very simple ui.

# Problem

Managing personal documents can be a faff. Ding adds a very small and at all times optional piece of software to your workflow. Ingest personal documents without overblown software stack. No webserver, not database, no proprietary format. Almost no config.

# Plans

- Readme / Howto
- Discuss Layout
- Autoconvert scanned image files to pdf
- Function to pass list of files via pipe
- Fix external command functions such as ocr, which always successes
